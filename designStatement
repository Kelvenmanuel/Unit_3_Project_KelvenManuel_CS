Kelven as a Client:

"Dear Khalid
I would like to start a business company, called Hot Hats, and in my house, I already have a set of Hats. 
At this instant, I do not identify a way to know the number of hats that I have. The hats present different brands, colors, and styles and popularity. 
Besides registering these categories, I want the program to provide the current price, release date, loan price and last time used. 
Additionally, I want the system to be only assessed by me or the people who would work with me.  

Regards from Kelven Manuel "

"I am going to create a software application, Shoe App, for my client. The program will help my client to recognize, and divide the characteristics of each shoe such as brand, colors, current price, retail price, past prices, and when the shoe was last used and the volatility rate as well. "
