Question 1:
Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters. 


```.py
#Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters.
countingnum = 0
countinglet = 0

word = [chr for chr in input()]
for char in word:
    if char.isdigit():
            countingnum+=1
    if char.isalpha():
            countinglet+=1

print("Letters", countinglet)
print("Digits", countingnum)
```

Question 2:
With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that i is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). The program should print the dictionary.

```.py
