 1.Planning
==============================================

### Definition of the problem 
  In 2020. A business Man, called Irving fang, is running a shoe company. The company name is Shoe with fang and they are responsible for selling high level and Quality shoes. Mr. Irving has a significant number of shoes and does not know how to manage it. Besides, He presents a variety of brands with different shoe colorways, prices, and volatility. 

### Proposed Solution 
   Create an Application of software/App using the programming language ```PYTHON```, one of the top-picked programming languages of most universities and industries. The purpose of this application is to assist the user to manage their shoe supply. Where this App will meet the needs of the company, organizing the shoe in a set of criteria given by the user(Mr. Irving), such as brand, colorway, and quantity. Moreover, this app will allow the user to give the price of the shoe, edit their data and delete unnecessary or outdated information about shoes.  

### Success criteria

1. Identify the brand and the country that produced the Shoe;
2. Information about how many shoes the inventory has;
3. Identify the colorway of every shoe; 
4. Recognize/provide the current price, past and retail price of every shoe;
5. Display the volatility of every shoe;
6. Provide the amount of sales that every shoe has;
7. Show the last time that the shoe was used;
8. Every shoe can be edited and deleted.

# T.E.L.O.S 
feasibility study:

  A feasibility study, in general, is a tool for determining whether you have what it takes to undertake a change or new project. In business, most managers make use of a particular feasibility tool called TELOS, an acronym for the five key areas that you need to consider in your study(business.tutsplus.com):

T - Technical - Is the project technically possible?
E - Economic - Can the project be afforded? Will it increase profit?
L - Legal - Is the project legal?
O - Operational - How will the current operations support the change?
S - Scheduling - Can the project be done in time? 
(Wiki/TELOS)

The user will be no longer unable to manage its supply of shoes. The App will be created to help the user to manage his shoe inventory. Using Python and Qt design we will be able to create a program that will meet all the necessities of the user. That is, it will achieve all the items in the success criteria. The program will have a simple process of installation, without a large cust for the user. For the developer the cust for creating the program is manageable.  The developer is using one of the most used programming languages that present no illegal issues, and there will be no divergence between the new system and any regulations. 


 2.Design 
==============================================

# System Diagram of the App
 

### 1 Step drawing the windows - Basic draw of a user face ( sketch of the App )

These are basic drawings of the windows/user faces intended for the App. Having this, we can start creating the windows using the QT design. The platform was chosen by reasons that will be mentioned below ( in the Development). Also, working with Pycharm (python language) in the end we expect to have all the windows. Therefore, we will be able to connect and run them.  
![planning](second.jpg)

### 2 Step 
 With Qt design, we designed user interfaces for the App. After that only left to convert the QT windows into python code then we will be able to run them and connect all of them. 
To convert QT Windows into python code we write in the terminal  ```.py pyuic5   (name of the window) -o (name of the window).py ```
 The images below show the windows created for the App, already running in python. Also, below the image, there is a stretch of the code that expresses the windows in python language.  
![planning](firste.png)

```.py
from PyQt5 import QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QDialog

class userface1Form(object):
    def setupUi(self, userface1):
        userface1.setObjectName("userface1")
        userface1.resize(366, 441)
        userface1.setStyleSheet(
            "color: qlineargradient(spread:pad, x1:0, y1:0, x2:1, y2:0, stop:0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 255), stop:1 rgba(255, 255, 255, 255));\n"
            "background-color: qlineargradient(spread:pad, x1:0.615463, y1:0.642045, x2:0.8867, y2:0.846591, stop:0.142857 rgba(0, 0, 0, 255), stop:1 rgba(255, 255, 255, 255));")
```

3.Development 
==============================================

### python
```PYTHON```is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.( Python wikipedia )

### Why I decided to use python

Python is one of the most used/appreciated programming language by developers and software engineers. A big number of applications and webs that we enjoy today are because of Python. Python presents versability and flexibility. Besides, abundant libraries, a collection of modules, and extensions that allow developers to create efficient programs. Additionally, python can do complex tasks and possess a clean syntax and it is easy to learn. It is recommendable for Beginners and experienced programmers. It can connect to database systems, and also, read and modify files.

### Qt Design
Qt Designer is Qt's tool for designing and building graphical user interfaces (GUIs) from Qt components. You can compose and customize your widgets or dialogs in a what-you-see-is-what-you-get (WYSIWYG) manner, and test them using different styles and resolutions. (designer-manual.html)

The Qt design is the tool that will be used to design the user interface (windows) for the App. It will be used because is easy to manage,  and We can obtain a good result with it. Moreover, We can use it with python. Providing that python is our main language to develop the project QT Design is the right tool.

# Coding and Running the App in Python ( Pycharm )

### Process Of Creating the App 


 Import windows to App runner 


```.py
from ShoeAppfinall.firstface import Ui_firstfaceForm as first
from ShoeAppfinall.Registration import Ui_RegistrationForm as reg                                                
from ShoeAppfinall.LogIn import Ui_loginForm as log
from ShoeAppfinall.loginRegistration import hash_password
from ShoeAppfinall.userface import Ui_userfaceForm as user
from ShoeAppfinall.Mainmenu import Ui_MainmenuForm as main
from ShoeAppfinall.App2 import ListofshoesA, PopularbrandsA, SportshoesA, SocialshoesA, RentedshoesA
```
2. Divide windows in classes and work on them
```.py
class firstfaceApp(QMainWindow, first):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        super(firstfaceApp, self).__init__(parent)
        self.setupUi(self)
```
3. examples of button behavior 
```.py
    def load_data(self):
        data = []
        with open('database.csv') as listdatabase:
            file = csv.reader(listdatabase, delimiter=",")
            for a, row in enumerate(file):
                for b, col in enumerate(row):
                    data.append([a, b, col])
                    self.tableWidget.setItem(a, b, QTableWidgetItem(col))
        return data
```

```.py 
    def try_login(self):
        #self.LogIn.clicked.connect(self.userf)
        user_name = self.lineEdit.text()
        password = self.lineEdit_2.text()
        print("Hashing", user_name + password)
        correct_password = user_name + password
        with open('Output.txt', "r") as output_file:
            for stored_password in output_file:
                if verify_password(stored_password, correct_password):
                    self.LogIn.clicked.connect(self.userf)
```
