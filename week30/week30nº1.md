â‘   Think about the topic and possible client for your personal IA for CS. Our goal is to have Criteria A finished before the end of the semester. 
Brainstorm and come up with 3 possible Topics. If you have not realized yet, the three projects we have had so far in Units 1, 2 and 3, were mini IAs for CS. So, 
you  are more than ready to start this journey.
