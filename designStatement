Kelven as a Client:

"Dear Khalid
I would like to start a business company, called Hot Hats, and in my house, I already have a set of Hats. 
At this instant, I do not identify a way to know the number of hats that I have. The hats present different brands, colors, and styles and popularity. 
Besides registering these categories, I want the program to provide the current price, release date, loan price and last time used. 
Additionally, I want the system to be only assessed by me or the people who would work with me.  

Regards from Kelven Manuel "

Kelven as a Developer: 

"I will design a shoe APPÂ  for my client. This program aims to help my client to identify and separate brands, style, past, current, and retail price of each shoe. 
Additionally, the shoes' amount of sales and the volatility rate."
