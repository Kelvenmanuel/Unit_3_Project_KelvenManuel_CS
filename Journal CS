Today 29/01/2020, we start learning a new programming language called Python, we did basic coding like print "Hello world", we did other programs about array and addition of numbers, 
This new way of programming is diffferent of the rest where I think C++ is easier than Python. C++ show us where we are making a mistake, but in Python you must wait until the end
I have some questions about how to define a variable, and how to coding in geral

today 05/02/2020 we keep working wiyh python and we create, with the teacher a program that print the largest prime factor,
besides this everyone had the chance to be a consumer that want a program to organize their products. As a consumer I want a program that organize my business of hats and the person that will create this program is Khalid,
and as a programer I will create the program to organize the shoes business of Irving, I still have some questions about the sysntax of Python but with the exercises I know I will understand better this coding language, 
I have to finish the homework about the site, I have 30% done and I will try to finish them as soon as possible and I might be able to have better understanding of the syntax of phyton.
