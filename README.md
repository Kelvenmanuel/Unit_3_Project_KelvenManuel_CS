 1.Planning
==============================================

### Definition of the problem 
In 2020. A business Man, called irving fang, is running a shoes company. The company name is Shoe with fang and they are responsible for selling high level and Quality shoes. Mr. Irving has a significant number of supply, and does not know how to manage it. Besides, He presents a variety of brands with diffeent shoe colorway, prices and volatility. 

### Proposed Solution 
Create an Application of software/App using the program language ```PYTHON```, one of the top-picked programming languages of most universities and industries. The purpose of this application is to assist the user to manage their shoe supply. Where this App will meet the needs of the company, organizing the shoe in a set of criteria given by the user(Mr. Irving), such as brand, colorway, and quantity. Moreover, this app will allow the user to give the price of the shoe, edit their data and delete unnecessary or outdated information about shoes.  

### Success criteria

1. Identify the brand and the country that produced the Shoe;
2. Information about how many shoe the iventory has;
3. Identify the colorway of every shoe; 
4. Recognize/provide the current price, past and retail price of every shoe;
5. Display the volarity of every shoe;
6. Provide the amount of sales that every shoe has;
7. Show the last time that the shoe was used;
8. Every shoe can be edited and deleted.



 2.Design 
==============================================

### python
```PYTHON```is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.[1]

### Why wI decided to use python

Python is one of the most used/appreciated programming language by developers and software engineers. A big number of applications and webs that we use/enjoy today are because of Python. Python presents a versability and flexibility. Besides, abundant libraries, a collection of modules, and extensions that allow developers to create efficient programs or apps. Additionally, python can do complex tasks and possess a clean syntax and it is easy to learn. It is recommendable for Beginners and experienced programmers. It can connect to database systems, and also, read and modify files.

3.Development 
==============================================


# Record of Tasks 
 
This table shows the 5 phases of the design: Planning, Design, Development, Test, and Implementation. 

| Task nº | Planned actions          |     Expected outcome            |   Time   |        Target 0pmpletion      | Criteria |

|   1     | Planning:                | Acquire the first               | 15 min   | Did not come with clear       |     A    |
|         | Meet with the client for | requirements of the client      |          | questions, nor did the client |          |
|         | the first conversation   |                                 |          | have clear requirements       |          |
|   2     | Development: Create      | A phyton scrip that allows      |  1 hour  | Developed functions such as   |          |
|         | a secure login system    | encrypted login of a user       |          | "log in" & "register", using  |     A    |
|         | using phyton             |                                 |          | an encrypted password system. |          |

|  3      | Planning:                | The success criteria for the    |  20 min  | Clear questions for the       |    A     |
|         | Meet with client for the | Iventory or Shoe App, details   |          | client, developer proposals   |          |
|         | 2nd conversation         | about the design & sytem of     |          | for the App                   |          | |         |                          | the App                         |          |                               |          | |         |                          |                                 |          |                               |          |
