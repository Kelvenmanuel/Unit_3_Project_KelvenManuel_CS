Second I would buy a memory(RAM) the place where I would store all my personal data and the computer codes, besides all the information the computer will always used, making me able to access it quickly. After that, the Storage. Between the SSD and the HDD, I would pick the SSD because is faster, more durable and does not use that much energy. With the storage I will be able to save/store files and data and I can also save then in external devices such as flash drives or my own phone. Then a Power supply unit(PSU) that will conver power from the outlet into usable power for the computer, besides, this component can control the overheating by controlling the voltage. I would by also, a Monitor and a Keyboard that together would allow me to input codes in the computer and use it. Finally, I would buy a Motherboard that is the primary circuit board of a computer and everything is connected to it.
