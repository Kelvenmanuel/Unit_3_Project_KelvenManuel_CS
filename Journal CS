Today 29/01/2020, we start learning a new programming language called Python, we did basic coding like print "Hello world", we did other programs about array and addition of numbers, 
This new way of programming is diffferent of the rest where I think C++ is easier than Python. C++ show us where we are making a mistake, but in Python you must wait until the end
I have some questions about how to define a variable, and how to coding in geral
