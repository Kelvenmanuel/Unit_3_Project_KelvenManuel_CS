feasibility study:

[2]. A feasibility study, in general, is a tool for determining whether you have what it takes to undertake a change or new project. In business, most managers make use of a particular feasibility tool called TELOS, an acronym for the five key areas that you need to consider in your study:

T - Technical - Is the project technically possible?
E - Economic - Can the project be afforded? Will it increase profit?
L - Legal - Is the project legal?
O - Operational - How will the current operations support the change?
S - Scheduling - Can the project be done in time? [3]

The user will be no longer unable to manage its supply of shoes. The App will be created to help the user to manage his shoe inventory. Using Python will be possible to create a program that will meet all the necessities of the user. That is, it will achieve all the items in the success criteria. The program will have a simple process of installation, without a large cust for the user. For the developer the cust for creating the program is manageable and this program will bring better benefits for the user.  The developer is using one of the most used programming languages that present no illegal issues, and there will be no divergence between the new system and any regulations. As I mentioned before the app will bring a large benefit for the user, and providing that is his first App the user should have or learn basic computational skills to manage it, but there is a certain question if the app can be used offline. Besides this, the work will certainly be automatized/improved. Considering the time that might be needed to finish the app, going through all the steps, the program can be done in time.
